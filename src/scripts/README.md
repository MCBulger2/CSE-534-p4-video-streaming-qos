# Scripts

[router_setup.sh](router_setup.sh) is a script based upon a script of the same name provided by the FABRIC testbed in their P4 example. It executes on each of the switch nodes to install the BMv2 docker image (also provided by the FABRIC testbed). I made modifications to this file to copy my own P4 programs to the Docker container, before compiling and running BMv2 to start the P4 switch's operation.
